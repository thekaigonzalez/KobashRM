# KOBASH REMASTERED
Kobash was originally a simple, python 2-3 prompt made for the average terminal user, 
but afterwards, I realized the codebase for kobash was very complex and almost impossible to write to.
so I decided to rewrite Kobash in Lua and C using almost pure techniques, with UGC in mind.

Read the documentation for Distribution makers.

Kobash is based off of FreeKSD & Kux. it also uses its own pure ecosystems
and doesn't rely on any external libraries, most, if not all of it's packed in.
